nginx and Waitress
Watch on YouTube: Deploy Django with NGINX and Waitress on Windows Server 2019
Steps
Download and copy nginx to C:/.

Install Python 3.7 in C:/Python37 and install

django, openpyxl and waitress
Edit ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py. Waitress will be running the Django server at http://localhost:8080.

Collect static files by running python manage.py collectstatic

Edit nginx_waitress/webproeject_nginx.conf

Edit the server_name

Edit the path to /static (and /media if needed)

Edit proxy_pass to match the server running from Waitress (i.e. runserver.py). This will usually be localhost or your IP address

Create two directories inside of C:/nginx/

Create sites-enabled and sites-available

Copy webproject_nginx.conf to the two directories

Edit C:/nginx/conf/nginx.conf

Add include <path to your sites-enabled/webproject_nginx.conf>;

Change port 80 to a non-essential port like 10. We will need to utilize 80 for our Django project

Open a terminal at C:/nginx/ and run nginx.exe -t to check files, and if everything is successful run nginx.exe to start the server

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost



after that create a service using nssm 

command : nssm install "Service Name" "file name"

after that nssm edit "Service Name" add path at python.exe

folder will be selected automatically

add filename.py as argument 



change tab to I/O (important)

set output and error and click save


rum command: nssm start "Service Name"
